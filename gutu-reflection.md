* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with 'git merge' and 'git fetch'. I was a little
confused when to use 'git fetch' and when to use 'git pull'.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The guide explined the differences and best practices of
'git fetch' and 'git pull'.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I consulted my pair on who should be the driver/navigator?
Why do we need to create a feature branch and how do we do that?
What are the best practices for writing a commit message?
* What still confuses you about Git?
When to use 'git push' and when to use 'git pus -u'.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
We were a little slow since it was the first time, but
overall i think it was better than I expected. The guide was
very helpfull when we had some questions but he let us do
all the work.
